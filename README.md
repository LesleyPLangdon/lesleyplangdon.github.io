## My adventures in programming


I am Lesley Langdon, wife, mother, amateur chef and horticulturist, and cum laude graduate pursuing a new career in computer science.  After careers as a restaurant manager and realtor I have finally found my passion.  My goal is to work in big data but I have enjoyed every course I have taken through my degree program so much that I will savor the opportunity to work my way up through a company.  My dream job will be at a company that is either so small that everyone works on every project or a company large enough to encourage team members to explore various roles and responsibilities.    
  
Thank you for visiting my digital portfolio. This is a collection of projects designed to show the scope of my education and the skills I have collected over the years. I have done my best in describing each project what the intent was educationally.
